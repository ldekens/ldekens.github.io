## Hi, not-so-lost stranger!  

I am a __third-year PhD candidate in the Department of Mathematics of the Camille Jordan Institute__ (ICJ), Lyon, France, supervised by Vincent Calvez (ICJ) and Sepideh Mirrahimi (IMT, Toulouse, France). I hold a BSc. in Mathematics from the École Normale Supérieure (ÉNS) de Lyon and a MSc. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the Claude Bernard University of Lyon and the ÉNS de Lyon. 


## Research interest  

My research interest lies at the __interface between evolutionary biology and mathematical models of population dynamics__ (mainly derterministic - PDEs). I believe that deterministic mathematical approaches are insightful to explain __complex trait dynamics arising from the interplay of ecological and evolutive phenomena in large populations__ and I like to build and analyse models that shed new lights on evolutionary questions. 

At the moment, I am looking at the __influence of the reproduction mode__ that shapes trait inheritance (asexual, or clonal, and sexual) on evolutionary dynamics in various settings (fragmented environment, invasive species etc...), through __quantitative genetic models__. 

I am very fortunate and grateful for having spent a year visiting __Sarah Otto's lab in the Biodiversity Research Center__, UBC, Vancouver, in immersion before and during my first year of PhD to learn more directly about evolutionary biologists' interests and questions.
