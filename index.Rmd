## Introduction

From November 2023, I have been a Postdoctoral Fellow at the __[Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/) (London)__, in the __[Difrisco lab of Theoretical Biology](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/james-difrisco)__. Previously, I was a __[FSMP](https://sciencesmaths-paris.fr/en/) postdoctoral fellow at the department of Applied Mathematics (MAP5) of the University of Paris__, after defending my PhD of Mathematics in July 2022, under the supervision of [Vincent Calvez](https://vcalvez.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) (ICJ, CNRS) and [Sepideh Mirrahimi](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~mirrahimi/) (IMAG, CNRS, Montpellier, France). I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics from the École Normale Supérieure (ÉNS) de Lyon and a M.Sc. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the Claude Bernard University of Lyon and the ÉNS de Lyon. 

From 2022 to 2024, I am a serving member of the Graduate Students Advisory Council (GSAC) of the Society for the [Study of Evolution](https://www.evolutionsociety.org/) (SSE). As such, I review applications for the Lewontin Awards (for early PhD students) and Rosemary Grant Awards (advanced PhD students) offered yearly by SSE. I also organize workshops for graduate students during the annual meeting "Evolution".


## Research interest  

My research interest lies at the __interface between evolutionary biology and mathematical models of population dynamics__ (mainly deterministic - PDEs). I believe that __mathematical modelling of biological phenomena leads to new and exciting problems that advance the field of PDE analysis__. At the same time, I think that deterministic mathematical approaches are insightful to explain __complex trait dynamics arising from the interplay of ecological and evolutive phenomena in large populations__ and I like to build and analyse models that shed new lights on evolutionary questions. 

__*What?*__ During my PhD, I have broadly investigated the influence of __spatial structure__ and __sexual reproduction__ (an inherently __non-linear and non-local collisionnal  process__) on the asymptotic dynamics of PDE systems. These correspond to __quantitative genetic models__ of eco-evolutionary dynamics. I am particularly interested in the modelling of the __evolution of genetic architecture__ and __intricate gene-traits associations__, as these are a prolific source of new operators with surprising properties.

__*Why?*__ One of the main analytical difficulties relates to __how sexual reproduction shapes the inheritance process of complex traits resulting from a large number of genes contributions__, even if each individual gene's inheritance is well understood. This opens the door to new mathematical challenges, as it involves __non-local and non-linear models for long-range interactions__,  as an offspring's trait can be far from both its parents' traits, and sptatial mixing phenomena that introduce further non-linear aspects to the analysis.
On the biological aspect, although __sexual reproduction is ubiquitous__ in multi-cellular organisms (plants, animals, fungi), there is only a handful of techniques that are developed to analyse the eco-evolutionary fate of large sexually reproducing populations characterized by a quantitative trait, like the size of individuals, the stamina of their muscles etc... 

## Previous experience of a theoretical biology lab

I am very fortunate and grateful for having spent a year visiting __Prof. [Sarah Otto](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~otto/)'s lab in the Biodiversity Research Center__, UBC, Vancouver, before and during my first year of PhD (2019-2020). In immersion, I learned more directly about evolutionary biologists' interests and questions, in particular about __theoretical relationships between population genetic and quantitative genetic models__. I am thrilled about our vivid overseas collaboration and invite you to consult our recent paper *The best of both worlds: combining population genetic and quantitative genetic models* (see link below), that proposes a composite model that bridges the two fields.

I aknowledge that, during that time, I have lived and worked in the traditional, unceded, and occupied territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) peoples.
